## Projects

### **Face Mask Detection (python, computer vision, opencv, darknet):**

• A simple machine learning model for face mask detection which can be used to detect the presence or absence of face mask.<br />
• Used yolov3 darknet framework for implementing the machine learning model and applied transfer learning technique.<br />
• Used opencv for image processing and model inference purpose.

### **Flutter App Development (python, computer-vision, tflite, dart):**
• Successfully built a Flutter App to identify 20 different plant leafs with some pictures using realtime database with smartphone camera.<br />
• Used yolov3 tensorflow api for implementing the machine learning model and applied transfer learning technique for finetuning of the model.<br />
• Converted tensorflow model to tensorflowlite model and integrated in the flutter application.
